La Columbina is just great. The massive Victoria box by Ensemble Plus Ultra ...
October 6, 2016
For an uneducated, but committed fan of all kinds of classical music, I simply detested this performance. Here's why: I have grown accustomed to renaissance music performed by one voice per part, or maybe two voices, and not by a chorus. The sound produced by a chorus, by this chorus, is imprecise, both logically (two people cannot sing exactly the same way all the time, if ever) and to my hearing. Add to that the miking, which is too distant (to accommodate the chorus?), and the entire affair is muddy, sloshy and completely unenjoyable. Go for a proper RENAISSANCE group, not a choral group. La Columbina is just great. The massive Victoria box by Ensemble Plus Ultra is fabulous. A real, vital part of Renaissance music is the immediacy, intimacy ... all lost here.

Victoria ... brought to vibrant, authoritative life by the four voices of the extraordinary Spanish group La Colombina (why haven’t I heard of them before?)
And we can only look forward to hearing more from this phenomenal vocal quartet as soon as possible. Bravo!
